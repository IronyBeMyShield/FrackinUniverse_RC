"^green;Introduction^white; - So, you fancy yourself a botanist? A scientist? Chemist? Whatever the case, you've a long road ahead of you. This guide will brief you on what you need to know.",

"^green;The Matter Assembler^white; First you need to figure out how to make a Matter Assembler. You'll need this to produce your lab equipment. It is absolutely essential. Check your wooden crafting table and get on it.",

"^green;The Extractor^white; - Next, you'll need an Extraction Lab. These machines are invaluable to any budding bio-engineer. You just toss whatever it is you want to pull materials from into it, press the buttons and BAM! Goodness comes out. I do however recommend against putting live creatures in there. Kittens extract poorly.",

"^green;Extraction^white; - You'll typically get one of a few things when extracting. Nutrient Paste, Tissue Cultures, Raw Minerals, Genetic Material or Oil. All have their uses, and you will definitely need some of each. Do try not to eat them. If you are really , really hungry...just be careful. Lead tastes like shit, for instance.",

"^green;Sampling^white; - The Sampling Array is one of your most valuable pieces of gear. Without it, you cannot create DNA Samples, Mineral Samples or Bio-Chips. All of these are essential in creating most plants. You'll need many of these. To make a DNA sample you need a vial, genetic material and tissue culture. For a mineral sample, swap that to nutrient paste and raw minerals.",

"^green;Sampling2^white; - Bio-Chips require a Mineral Sample, a DNA Sample and a Bio-Chip Base. Sampling takes time, so you can toss a ton of resources in there at once, and leave to go do some stuff. Note that this machine can take other resources too, and produce other things besides the dna and mineral samples...",

"^green;Sampling3^white; - The array can also produce numerous other goods. Graphene, Blister Extract, Alien Compound and even some complicated enhancements to armor and weapons. You can find the basic recipes (Graphene, Alien Compound, Blister Extract, Mutavisk Thread) on the mod page for FrackinUniverse. The complicated ones are up to you to discover.",

"^green;Finding Resources^white; - Genetic Material is most commonly found in meats, certain plants and similar stuff. You'll find Raw Minerals in stone, ore and other things rich in mineral content. Tissue Culture is most common from plants, seeds and produce. Oil is now found in many places. Sand and Tar are your best bets.",

"^green;Methanol^white; - Methanol is an important resource for several goods. Where it's found is pretty straightforward. Cut down some trees. Extract from the wood in your extractor. Simple as that!",

"^green;Mining^white; - You probably don't want to do much hard work. You're a science guy, after all right? Tough cookies. Get your matter manipulator and start digging (or build a mining gun in the Matter Assembler). Otherwise you'll never find what you need. ",

"^green;Lab Space^white; - With your Matter Assembler placed, you are probably starting to realize that you will need a substantial amount of space for your lab. Any self-respecting scientist would make room for such a glorious thing! Who DOESN'T want a lab?!?! But I get ahead of myself here...You'll be able to create several more labs now. Next up, a BioChem Lab.",

"^green;Bio-Chemistry^white; - The BioChem Lab is your all-in-one chemistry station. Any sort of tinkering involving formulas is done here. Likewise, you can produce some more...interesting things. Such as unstable particles for use in energy weapons. Without the formulas made here, you will not be able to create the more interesting plants.",

"^green;Plastic and Silicon pt 1^white; - To make some products, you'll need Plastic. In order to make Plastic, you first need to get some silk. Bracken trees shed silk. Plant some of those if you want easy access plastic.",

"^green;Plastic and Silicon pt 2^white; - On the other hand, a super-pure form of Silicon can only be found on crystal moons. No other silicon is pure enough for the complex gear you will be creating. So, go check one out and get cracking. Crystal is hard to break, though. Bring a sturdy pickaxe.",

"^green;Xeno-Research Lab^white; - Now you'll need a Xeno Research Lab. This sweet baby will produce various sorts of research materials, gene sequences and other deliciously scientific things. With these, you can create plants by combining the goods in a Gene Design Lab. That's next. First, build yourself the Xeno Research Lab.",

"^green;Designing Genes^white; - The Gene Design Lab is your best friend. Here, you combine all the things you've made in previously built stations in order to create new seeds! Without this, you're sunk!",

"^green;Cloning from Seeds^white; - Finally, the Cloning Lab can be built, though it is not necessarily essential. Here you can create modified versions of seeds, with new effects. You need 3 of a seed, a mutagen and a chemical reagent, which are craftable at the BioChem Lab if you can find the recipes.",

"^green;Storing Your Goods^white; - Need somewhere to store the dozens of resources you're inevitably going to create through your research? Well, the solution is simple enough: Gene Cabinets. Build a couple of these and you will be good to go. And they're cheap and easy to make!",

"^green;Fertilizer^white; - A large portion of recipes for research or plant seeds will require Fertilizer in order to be created. That means you'll need sulphur, oil and synthesized protein. Sulphur needs to be mined, in case you forgot. Try making a few barrels. There are varying strengths of fertilizer, and some plants will require the more advanced forms. ",

"^green;Caliche^white; - Caliche stone is extremely useful, producing both saltpeter and iodine. You'll need both. Finding Caliche can be tricky if you don't know where to look. Check deserts, they typically have a lot.",

"^green;Other Resources^white; - You'll soon find tons of resources, some of which will come from natural sources like ores, stones and algae. All of it will be used in one recipe or another. You'll definitely need to explore various types of worlds. So, do yourself a favor and check them all out if you want to complete your research with the rarer goods.",

"^green;New Worlds^white; - There are new worlds across the cosmos awaiting exploration. Try finding one of the strange Proto Worlds and gathering the resources they have to offer. For instance, a mysterious and largely unknown element called Protocyte can be found on them. And with it, you can make some very useful things. You want Protocyte.",

"^green;Experimentation^white; - There is a lot more to learn, though the information presented thus far should be adequate to get you started. Experiment and see what you can come up with!"
